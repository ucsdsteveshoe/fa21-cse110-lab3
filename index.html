                <p> Our 110 CSE coding group project will be to create a fully animated feature-length movie featuring the <i>Mario Brothers</i>. </p>
                <p> Previously, we tabled the discussion on who would be responsible for animating given we are all software developers. </p>
                <div> This meeting, Steven agreed to tackle 90% of the project effort. He stressed that this would not be a free effort and he <strong>must</strong> be paid in snacks</div>
                <p> After a long pause, Chris agreed to be the main supplier of goldfish crackers. Delivery process would be direct-to-mouth (see diagram below) </p>

                <h3 id="section3"> Review Currently Suggested Cast</h3>
                <p> At the moment, our plan is to rip off the sound bytes of <span>currently involved</span> actors (see video below)</p>
                <video src="data/meeting.mp4" width=300 height=168 controls></video>
                <p> It was discussed that if the movie launches after our project is due for completion, we <em>could</em> just have our movie feature audio clips of Chris Pratt from other cinematography</p>
                <p> We decided to table this possibility for next meeting and go get food </p>

                <p> Steven voiced his conern that we <em>might</em> not be able to legally rip sound from an entire movie. <div class="newlineDiv"> This concern was met with silence. </div></p>
